The Automated Reasoning group at UCLA is directed by professor Adnan Darwiche.

The group focuses on research in the areas of probabilistic and logical reasoning and their applications
to problems in science and engineering disciplines. 

On the theoretical side, the research involves formulation of various tasks such as machine learning, 
diagnosis, belief revision, planning and verification as reasoning problems. 

On the practical side, the group focuses on the development of efficient and embeddable reasoning algorithms
that can scale to real-world problems, and software environments that can be used to construct and validate
large-scale models.
